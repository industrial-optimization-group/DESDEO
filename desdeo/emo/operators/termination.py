"""The base class for termination criteria.

The termination criterion is used to determine when the optimization process should stop. In this implementation, it
also includes a simple counter for the number of elapsed generations. This counter is increased by one each time the
termination criterion is called. The simplest termination criterion is reaching the maximum number of generations.
The implementation also contains a counter for the number of evaluations. This counter is updated by the Evaluator
and Generator classes. The termination criterion can be based on the number of evaluations as well.

Warning:
    Each subclass of BaseTerminator must implement the do method. The do method should always call the
    super().do method to increment the generation counter _before_ conducting the termination check.
