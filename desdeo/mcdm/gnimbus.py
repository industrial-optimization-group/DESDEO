    r"""Solves a desired number of sub-problems as defined in the NIMBUS methods.

    Solves 1-4 scalarized problems utilizing different scalarization
    functions. The scalarizations are based on the classification of a
    solutions provided by a decision maker. The classifications
    are represented by a reference point. Returns a number of new solutions
    corresponding to the number of scalarization functions solved.

    Depending on `num_desired`, solves the following scalarized problems corresponding
    the the following scalarization functions:

    1.  the NIMBUS scalarization function,
    2.  the STOM scalarization function,
    3.  the achievement scalarizing function, and
    4.  the GUESS scalarization function.

    Raises:
        NimbusError: the given problem has an undefined ideal or nadir point, or both.
        NimbusError: either the reference point of current objective functions value are
            missing entries for one or more of the objective functions defined in the problem.

    Args:
        problem (Problem): the problem being solved.
        current_objectives (dict[str, float]): an objective dictionary with the objective functions values
            the classifications have been given with respect to.
        reference_point (dict[str, float]): an objective dictionary with a reference point.
            The classifications utilized in the sub problems are derived from
            the reference point.
        num_desired (int): the number of desired solutions to be solved. Solves as
            many scalarized problems. The value must be in the range 1-4.
        scalarization_options (dict | None, optional): optional kwargs passed to the scalarization function.
            Defaults to None.
        create_solver (CreateSolverType | None, optional): a function that given a problem, will return a solver.
            If not given, an appropriate solver will be automatically determined based on the features of `problem`.
            Defaults to None.
        solver_options (SolverOptions | None, optional): optional options passed
            to the `create_solver` routine. Ignored if `create_solver` is `None`.
            Defaults to None.

    Returns:
        list[SolverResults]: a list of `SolverResults` objects. Contains as many elements
            as defined in `num_desired`.
