    Infers the classifications based on a given reference point and current objective function
    values. The following classifications are inferred for each objective:

    - $I^{<}$: values that should improve, the reference point value of an objective
        function is equal to its ideal value;
    - $I^{\leq}$: values that should improve until a given aspiration level, the reference point
        value of an objective function is better than the current value;
    - $I^{=}$: values that should stay as they are, the reference point value of an objective
        function is equal to the current value;
    - $I^{\geq}$: values that can be impaired until some reservation level, the reference point
        value of an objective function is worse than the current value; and
    - $I^{\diamond}$: values that are allowed to change freely, the reference point value of
        and objective function is equal to its nadir value.

    The aspiration levels and the reservation levels are then given for each classification, when relevant, in
    the return value of this function as the following example demonstrates:

    ```python
    classifications = {
        "f_1": ("<", None),

        "f_3": (">=", 22.2),

            problem are undefined.
