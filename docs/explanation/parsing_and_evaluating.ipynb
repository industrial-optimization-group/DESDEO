    "\n",
    "In DESDEO, the problem format (c.f., section [The Problem Format](./problem_format.ipynb))\n",
    "can be parsed into other formats and evaluated. The purpose of evaluating is to\n",
    "allow different solvers, discussed in section [Solvers](./solvers.ipynb), to solve\n",
    "the modeled multiobjective optimization problem. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we will first discuss the parsing and the parsers found in DESDEO in\n",
    "section [Parsing and parsers](#parsing-and-parsers). Then, we will discuss the\n",
    "evaluators available in DESDEO for evaluating multiobjective optimization\n",
    "problems in section [Evaluating and evaluators](#evaluating-and-evaluators).\n",
    "After these sections, the reader should have a basic understanding on how \n",
    "the problems defined in DESDEO are evaluated.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Parsing and parsers\n",
    "\n",
    "### From the problem format to other formats\n",
    "The most central parsers in DESDEO are those that allow parsing the problem\n",
    "format from the MathJSON format discussed in section [The MathJSON\n",
    "format](./problem_format.ipynb#the-mathjson-format) to other formats that different\n",
    "solvers (i.e., optimizers)\n",
    "can understand. These kind of parsers can be found in the [JSON parser][desdeo.problem.json_parser]\n",
    "module.\n",
    "\n",
    "The [MathParser][desdeo.problem.json_parser.MathParser] handles parsing of the problem format\n",
    "into a polars format, a pyomo format, a sympy format, or a gurobipy format.\n",
    "In the polars and sympy formats, the problem is represented by polars and sympy expressions.\n",
    "Likewise, in the pyomo and gurobipy formats, the problem is represented as a pyomo or gurobipy model.\n",
    "This allows different solvers to handle the problems we have defined in DESDEO.\n",
    "\n",
    "### From other formats to the problem format\n",
    "\n",
    "DESDEO has also parsers that allow other formats to be parsed into the MathJSON format\n",
    "representing multiobjective optimization problems. The most notable of these, and the currently\n",
    "only one present, is the infix notation parser found in the [Infix parser][desdeo.problem.infix_parser]\n",
    "module. This allows mathematical expression formatted in a typical infix format, i.e.,\n",
    "how one would regularly write a mathematical expression down, e.g., `x * 2 - y`, to the MathJSON\n",
    "format:\n",
    "\n",
    "```json\n",
    "[\"Add\",\n",
    "    [\"Multiply\", \"x\", 2],\n",
    "    [\"Negate\", \"y\"]\n",
    "]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This is useful when one wants to model a multiobjective optimization problem in DESDEO since it\n",
    "allows the function expression to be written down as they are, without requiring a manual conversion to\n",
    "the MathJSON format first. When adding function expression to the [Problem model][desdeo.problem.schema.Problem],\n",
    "if a `func` field is initialized with a string in an infix format, it is automatically converted to the JSON\n",
    "format utilizing the infix parser. The infix parser can also prove useful when defining various\n",
    "scalarization functions in a dynamic way (c.f., the section [Scalarization](./scalarization.ipynb#scalarization)).\n",

    "<div class=\"admonition note\">\n",
    "<p class=\"admonition-title\">Note</p>\n",

    "    into the MathJSON format consecutively multiple times, as can be the case with some navigation-based methods,\n",
    "    then the overhead might accumulate slowing the method down considerably. In such cases, it is advised to\n",

    "## Evaluating and evaluators\n",
    "\n",
    "While parsers transform the problem format in DESDEO from one representation to another,\n",
    "evaluators enable the evaluating of a problem, usually by supplying one or more\n",
    "decision variable vectors. Evaluators are not something a user is expected to directly\n",
    "utilize, rather, evaluators are often tied to solvers and solver interfaces, which\n",
    "are discussed in the [Solvers](./solvers.ipynb) section.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to understand in which order the various fields found \n",
    "in the problem format (c.f., [The Problem schema](./problem_format.ipynb#the-problem-schema)\n",
    "and [Problem][desdeo.problem.schema.Problem]) are evaluated.\n",
    "The first field to be evaluated is the `constants` field, which is made up of\n",
    "[`Constant`][desdeo.problem.schema.Constant] models. Evaluating these fields amounts to\n",
    "replacing the symbol of the constant with its numerical value, or defining an internal\n",
    "variable with the same value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, the `extra_funcs` field made up of [`ExtraFunction`][desdeo.problem.schema.ExtraFunction]\n",
    "models is evaluated. This assumes that the extra functions might utilize constants in them, which\n",
    "requires the constants to be available prior to the evaluation. Naturally, evaluating any extra\n",
    "functions is skipped if they are not defined for the problem being evaluated.\n",
    "\n",
    "After the extra functions, the [`Objective`][desdeo.problem.schema.Objective] models, found\n",
    "in the field `objectives` of the problem, are evaluated. These can depend on constants\n",
    "and extra functions, which means that these must have been evaluated prior to evaluating any\n",
    "objectives.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, any [`Constraint`][desdeo.problem.schema.Constraint] models in the `constraints` field\n",
    "of the problem are evaluated. This assumes that prior to evaluating any constraints, any\n",
    "constants, extra functions, or objectives utilized in the constraint have been evaluated.\n",
    "Objectives might be part of a constraint in, e.g., the epsilon-constraint scalarization.\n",
    "If no constraints have been defined, then this step is skipped.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, any [`ScalarizationFunction`][desdeo.problem.schema.ScalarizationFunction] present\n",
    "in the `scalarizations_funcs` field are evaluated. These can again depend on any of the\n",
    "constants, extra functions, constraints, or objectives defined for the problem. If no\n",
    "scalarization functions have been defined, then their evaluation is skipped.\n",
    "\n",
    "The order of evaluation is important to understand to avoid bugs and unexpected behavior when\n",
    "defining problems in DESDEO. The order of evaluating the fields found in the problem model\n",
    "has been summarized in the list below:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Constants, if any.\n",
    "2. Extra functions, if any.\n",
    "3. Objective functions.\n",
    "4. Constraint functions, if any.\n",
    "5. Scalarization functions, if any.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The generic evaluator\n",
    "\n",
    "The [`GenericEvaluator`][desdeo.problem.evaluator.GenericEvaluator]\n",
    "is for evaluating problems to be solved with solvers that expect the\n",
    "problem to be defined as Python functions. It can be utilized in two modes:\n",
    "`variables` or `discrete`. In the first mode, the problem is expected to be \n",
    "evaluated with a given set of decision variable vectors. In the discrete mode,\n",
    "the problem is evaluated based on its discrete representation (c.f., \n",
    "[DiscreteRepresentation][desdeo.problem.schema.DiscreteRepresentation]).\n",
    "\n",
    "If the `variables` mode is used, then a polars evaluator is utilized. As the\n",
    "name suggests, the polars evaluator utilizes polars dataframes to represent a\n",
    "problem and evaluate it. The function expression found in the problem are parsed\n",
    "to polars expression. This allows any Python-based solver to evaluate the\n",
    "problem with given decision variable values. The polars evaluator currently\n",
    "supports variables that are either scalar valued or 2D-vector valued\n",
    "(basically one dimensional TensorVariables).\n",
    "Higher dimensions on the decision variables are not supported.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the `discrete` mode is used, then the problem is expected to be completely\n",
    "defined by decision and objective vector pairs. When the problem is then\n",
    "evaluated with a given set of decision variable vectors, the closest vectors are\n",
    "searched for in the problem's discrete representation, and the corresponding\n",
    "objective function values are then returned. The discrete evaluator only\n",
    "supports scalar valued variables, not TensorVariables, at the moment.\n",
    "\n",
    "The generic evaluator is utilized by solvers that do not expect, or require, the\n",
    "exact formulation of the problem. That is, heuristics based and gradient-free\n",
    "solvers. At the moment, these solvers implemented in DESDEO are\n",
    "the [`Scipy solvers`][desdeo.tools.scipy_solver_interfaces] and\n",
