    "# The Problem format\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiobjective optimization problems are represented by pydantic dataclasses\n",
    "in DESDEO. These are serializable and therefore easy to store. Moreover,\n",
    "they can be readily transformed into JSON objects, which makes passing\n",
    "them from DESDEO's web-API to various frontend applications seamless. This\n",
    "also facilitates the parsing of the problem format into other formats as well.\n",
    "While representing problems as pydantic dataclasses comes with some overhead,\n",
    "this is justified by the utility and robustness of the pydantic dataclasses.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the challenges with this kind of representation is representing function\n",
    "expression. These have been taken care by exploiting the MathJSON format, which\n",
    "is described in more details in the section\n",
    "[The MathJSONformat](#the-mathjson-format). The pydantic dataclass for representing a\n",
    "multiobjective optimization problem in DESDEO is discussed in the section\n",
    "[The Problem schema](#the-problem-schema), where the structure, or schema, of the\n",
    "dataclass is described in detail.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The MathJSON format\n",
    "\n",
    "MathJSON is a lightweight, JSON-based format designed for representing\n",
    "mathematical expressions in a structured and easily parsable manner. It provides\n",
    "a standardized way to represent mathematical notation within JSON objects.\n",
    "Moreover, it allows users to define mathematical formulations in web-based\n",
    "frontend applications, which can then be directly represented in the DESDEO\n",
    "problem schema.\n",
    "\n",
    "In DESDEO, the MathJSON format is utilized to represent function\n",
    "expression found throughout the problem schema. MathJSON follows\n",
    "Polish notation, which means that mathematical operators precede\n",
    "the operands when defining mathematical expressions. As an example,\n",
    "consider the following expression:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\max(x, y ,z) + \\frac{y}{z} - \\sin\\left(z^x + 4.2\\right)^3,\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where x, y, and x are some variables. The equivalent of this\n",
    "expression in the MathJSON format (Polish notation), would be:\n",
    "\n",
    "```json\n",
    "[\n",
    "  \"Add\",\n",
    "  [\"Divide\", \"y\", \"z\"],\n",
    "  [\"Max\", \"x\", \"y\", \"z\"],\n",
    "  [\n",
    "    \"Negate\",\n",
    "    [\"Power\", [\"Sin\", [\"Add\", [\"Power\", \"z\", \"x\"], 4.2]], 3]\n",
    "  ]\n",
    "]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "At first glance, this may look overly complicated, but from a programming\n",
    "perspective, parsing Polish notation is much simpler than infix notation,\n",
    "e.g., \"normal\" notation, where the operations are between the operands.\n",
    "\n",
    "The MathJSON notation is utilized for all function expressions found\n",
    "in the problem schema in DESDEO. For more information on the MathJSON\n",
    "format, see the [MathJSON project](https://cortexjs.io/math-json/).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Problem schema\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, the structure of the problem dataclass, or the schema, is presented\n",
    "in detail. The `Problem` dataclass itself is constructed from other dataclasses\n",
    "contained in its field.  We will refer to the schemas as _models_ from thereon.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The symbol field\n",
    "\n",
    "Across many of the models found in the `Problem` dataclass, the field `symbol`\n",
    "will be often present. This field is very important, because it is utilized\n",
    "to identify variables and function expression across the `Problem` model.\n",
    "Therefore, the `symbol` field should contain a symbol that is unique across the\n",
    "whole `Problem` model. The symbol itself is nothing more than a string value.\n",
    "Some symbol names are reserved in DESDEO, and users should avoid defining\n",
    "variables or function expression with these symbols. Reserved symbols\n",
    "are discussed in the section [Symbols and expressions](#symbols-and-expressions).\n",
    "\n",
    "### The scenario keys field\n",
    "\n",
    "As with the `symbol` field, the `scenario_keys` is also a recurring field\n",
    "across the `Problem` model. This field is used to indicate to which scenario,\n",
    "or scenarios, a field (e.g., representing an objective function) belongs to.\n",
    "The `scenario_keys` is a list of strings and is optional. When its value\n",
    "is `None` is means that it belongs to all defined scenarios, or no\n",
    "scenarios at all if the problem has no defined scenarios. The `Problem`\n",
    "model itself has also the field `scenario_keys`, which is used indicate\n",
    "which scenarios haven been defined for the `Problem`. When this field\n",
    "is `None`, it means the `Problem` has no defined scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Common fields for computable models\n",
    "\n",
    "The computable models that are used to construct a `Problem` all have some common\n",
    "fields defined for them. The computable models are `Objective`, `Constraint`,\n",
    "`ExtraFunction`, and `ScalarizationFunction`. These fields generally\n",
    "represent something that can be evaluated, and is likely to be optimized at some\n",
    "point, either directly, or indirectly, e.g., as part of a scalarization.\n",
    "The common fields are:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - `is_linear`: is the model linear?\n",
    "  - `is_convex`: is the model convex?\n",
    "  - `is_twice_differentiable`: is the model twice continuously differentiable?\n",
    "\n",
    "These are all assumed to be `False` by default. The listed fields play an important\n",
    "role in the selection of optimizer when the `Problem` model is being solved.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "The main dataclass storing information related to a multiobjective optimization is the\n",
    "`Problem` model, which consists of other models. \n",
    "The `Problem` model itself consists of the following fields:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - `name`: the name of the problem,\n",
    "  - `description`: the description of the problem,\n",
    "  - `constants`: a list of constant utilized in the definition of the problem,\n",
    "  - `variables`: a list of the variables of the problem,\n",
    "  - `objectives`: a list of the objective functions of the problem,\n",
    "  - `constraints`: an optional list of the constraints of the problem,\n",
    "  - `extra_funcs`: an optional list of extra functions utilized in defining the problem, \n",
    "  - `scalarization_funcs`: an optional list of scalarized representations of the problem,\n",
    "  - `discrete_representation`: an optional representation of the problem as discrete decision variable vector and objective vector pairs, and\n",
    "  - `scenario_keys`: an optional list of scenario keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **name** and **description** of the problem are just strings. The other fields consist of one or\n",
    "more additional models, or Python types, such as lists. These will be described next.\n",
    "\n",

    "<p class=\"admonition-title\">Note</p>\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "    The <tt>symbol</tt> entries across all fields must be unique. If one or more\n",

    "## Symbols and expressions\n",
    "\n",
    "The field `symbol`, which is found across the `Problem` schema, plays a very important role\n",
    "in DESDEO. It is utilized to identify variables, constants, and function expression. Symbols\n",
    "can also be utilized across the fields of `Problem` to refer to each other. In other words,\n",
    "the `func` field in a `ScalarizationModel` can contain the symbol referencing\n",
    "the `func` field of an `ExtraFunction`, or the value of a `Constant`, for instance. This is\n",
    "also an important fact to keep in mind when parsing the a `Problem` model from one\n",
    "representation to another. This will be discussed in more detail in the \n",
    "section [Parsing and Evaluating Problems](./parsing_and_evaluating.md/#parsing-and-evaluating-problems).\n",
    "\n",
    "It is assumed that any expression in a `func` field, that is not a numerical value,\n",
    "refers to either a symbol or a mathematical operation. In what follows, the\n",
    "reserved symbols are presented in the section [Reserved symbols](#reserved-symbols).\n",
    "The supported mathematical expressions are presented in the section\n",
    "[Supported expression](#supported-expressions).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reserved symbols\n",
    "\n",
    "In essence, any symbol that starts with an underscore, e.g., `_x` is considered\n",
    "to be reserved. This is because some of the routines in DESDEO that manipulate the\n",
    "problem formulation may add, for instance, auxiliary variables, which are\n",
    "automatically named with a symbol that starts with an underscore. To avoid\n",
    "confusion and bugs, users are advised to avoid utilizing symbols\n",
    "starting with underscores when defining problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another symbol, which is should be avoided, is any symbol that ends in\n",
    "`_min`, e.g., `f_1_min`. Since DESDEO internally transforms all\n",
    "expressions to be optimized into their minimization form, routines will\n",
    "append a `_min` to symbols to indicate that the expression the symbol\n",
    " represents, is to be, or has been, minimized. Other routines will\n",
    " expect these symbols to be available. Users are therefore advised to\n",
    " avoid symbols that end in a `_min`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Scalar and indexed expressions\n",
    "\n",
    "DESDEO supports two kinds of expresssions: scalar and indexed ones. A scalar\n",
    "expression represents a single value or variable, while an indexed\n",
    "expression represents a collection of values or variables. For instance,\n",
    "an instance of the `Variable` or `Constant` model would\n",
    "represent a scalar expression, and an instance of the `TensorVariable`\n",
    "or `TensorConstant` would represent an indexed expression. \n",
    "\n",
    "Both scalar and indexed expression may be combined, such\n",
    "as taking the dot product of two indexed expressions representing\n",
    "vectors and adding a scalar to it. Some operators work only\n",
    "with scalar expressions, while others work with only indexed ones.\n",
    "Please refer to the table in the next section for further details\n",
    "on which operations support which type of expression.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"admonition note\">\n",
    "<p class=\"admonition-title\">Note</p>\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "    When modeling a problem that contains indexed expressions,\n",
    "    it is important to choose a solver that supports indexed expressions.\n",
    "    Please refer to the section\n",
    "    <a href=\"./solvers.ipynb/#summary-of-solvers\">Summary of Solvers</a>\n",
    "    for further details on which solvers support solving problems with\n",
    "    indexed expressions and their operators.\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Supported Operations\n",
    "\n",
    "Expressions representing mathematical operations are\n",
    "automatically identified by DESDEO. The expressions\n",
    "are case sensitive. Currently supported operations are listed\n",
    "in the table below:\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"admonition note\">\n",
    "<p class=\"admonition-title\">Note</p>\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "    The equivalent infix notation operator is given in parentheses.\n",
    "    For operators without this equivalent, the operator will\n",
    "    still work in infix notation, e.g., `Sin(x) + 3`.\n",
