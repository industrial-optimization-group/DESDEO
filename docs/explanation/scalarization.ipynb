    "The core idea of scalarization in DESDEO is that scalarization functions\n",
    "are added to an existing [Problem][desdeo.problem.schema.Problem], and they are\n",
    "stored in its [scalarization_funcs][desdeo.problem.schema.Problem.scalarization_funcs] field.\n",
    "When a scalarization function is added to a problem, it does not modify the original\n",

    "problem with the added scalarization, and possibly other elements, such as constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "When adding scalarization functions, it is very important to keep track of the added\n",
    "scalarization's [symbol][desdeo.problem.schema.ScalarizationFunction.symbol]. This\n",
    "is utilized, later on, in solver, and must be supplied to the solver so that\n",
    "it is aware of the function it should optimize. This is why the functions that\n",
    "add scalarizations return also the symbol that has been used when defining\n",
    "the [ScalarizationFunction][desdeo.problem.schema.ScalarizationFunction] that\n",
    "has been added to the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is one last important note about scalarization functions. All scalarization\n",
    "functions are defines with the assumption that all of the objective functions,\n",
    "and elements related to the objective function values, e.g., the ideal and the nadir point,\n",
    "a possible reference point, have been defined such that the objective functions\n",
    "are to be minimized. This means that the scalarization function implementation\n",
    "will refer to objective functions with the `_min` post-fix. E.g., a scalarization\n",
    "function will refer to an objective function `f_1` as `f_1_min`. __It is \n",
    "the responsibility of the evaluators found in DESDEO to make sure that the\n",
