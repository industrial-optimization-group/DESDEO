    "# Solvers\n",
    "\n",
    "While DESDEO is a framework for interactive multiobjective \n",
    "optimization, it does not implement any optimizers _per se_.\n",
    "Instead, DESDEO provides interfaces to many existing solvers.\n",
    "How these interfaces work in general is explained in the \n",
    "section [Solver interfaces](#solver-interfaces), while the\n",
    "currently implemented solvers in DESDEO are introduced and\n",
    "a couple of examples on how to use the solvers are\n",
    "given in the section [Solver examples](#solver-examples).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Solver interfaces\n",
    "\n",
    "The solver interfaces rely internally heavily on the evaluators discussed\n",
    "in the section [Parsing and evaluating](../parsing_and_evaluating). It is\n",
    "the evaluators that make sure the `Problem` being solved is in a format that\n",
    "can be evaluated by a solver. The solver interfaces discussed here are\n",
    "in charge of making sure that when an outside solver evaluates a problem, the information\n",
    "from the solver is passed to the evaluator in a correct format, and that the\n",
    "output of the solver is then processed in a way that it can be utilized elsewhere\n",
    "in DESDEO. The interfaces also pass information from DESDEO to solvers\n",
    "in a compatible format. To put it simply, the solver interfaces are translators between the\n",
    "evaluators in DESDEO and the solvers found outside of DESDEO.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Solver examples\n",
    "\n",
    "How solvers can be utilized in practice is best illustrated with examples. We provide\n",
