# Test problems

In DESDEO, some known test problem have been implemented and may be used to test the framework and the optimization methods implemented in it.
Here, some of those test problems are introduced and described.

## The four bar truss design problem (RE21)

The four bar truss design problem [1] has, as its two objective funtions, structural volume and joint displacement, and areas of member cross-sections as the four decision variables. The decision variables are constrained has four constraints related to member stresses. The variables are continuous and the problem's Pareto front is convex.

The objective functions and constraints for the four bar truss design problem are defined as follows:

$$\begin{align}
    &\min_{\mathbf{x}} & f_1(\mathbf{x}) & = L(2x_1 + \sqrt{2}x_2 + \sqrt{x_3} + x_4) \\
    & & f_2(\mathbf{x}) & = \frac{FL}{E}\left(\frac{2}{x_1} + \frac{2\sqrt{2}}{x_2}
    - \frac{2\sqrt{2}}{x_3} + \frac{2}{x_4}\right) \\
    &\text{s.t.,}   & \frac{F}{\sigma} \leq x_1 & \leq 3\frac{F}{\sigma},\\
    & & \sqrt{2}\frac{F}{\sigma} \leq x_2 & \leq 3\frac{F}{\sigma},\\
    & & \sqrt{2}\frac{F}{\sigma} \leq x_3 & \leq 3\frac{F}{\sigma},\\
    & & \frac{F}{\sigma} \leq x_4 & \leq 3\frac{F}{\sigma},\\
\end{align}$$

where $x_1, x_4 \in [a, 3a]$, $x_2, x_3 \in [\sqrt{2}a, 3a]$, and $a = F/\sigma$. The parameters are defined as $F = 10$ $kN$, $E = 2e^5$ $kN/cm^2$, $L = 200$ $cm$, and $\sigma = 10$ $kN/cm^2$.

Here is an approximation of the four bar truss design problem's Pareto front:

## The reinforced concrete beam design problem (RE22)

In the reinforced concrete beam design problem [3], the first objective is to minimize the total cost of concrete and reinforcing steel of the beam. The second objective is to minimize the sum of the two constraint violations. The decision variable $x_1$ has a predefined discrete value[^1] from 0.2 to 15. That makes the decision variables a mix of continuous and discrete variables.

The objective functions and constraints for the reinforced concrete beam design problem are defined as follows:

$$\begin{align}
    &\min_{\mathbf{x}} & f_1(\mathbf{x}) & = 29.4x_1 + 0.6x_2x_3 \\
    & & f_2(\mathbf{x}) & = \sum_{i=1}^2 \max\{g_i(\mathbf{x}), 0\} \\
    &\text{s.t.,}   & g_1(\mathbf{x}) & = x_1x_3 - 7.735\frac{x_1^2}{x_2} - 180 \geq 0,\\
    & & g_2(\mathbf{x}) & = 4 - \frac{x_3}{x_2} \geq 0,
\end{align}$$

where $x_2 \in [0,20]$ and $x_3 \in [0,40].$

Here is an approximation of the reinforced concrete beam design problem's Pareto front:

## The pressure vessel design problem (RE23)

The pressure vessel design problem [4] involves a cylindrical pressure vessel that is capped at both ends by hemispherical heads. The first objective is to minimize the total cost, including the cost of material, forming and welding. The second objective is to minimize the sum of the three constraint violations. The decision variables $x_1$ and $x_2$ represent the thickness of the shell and the head, and the decision variables $x_3$ and $x_4$ represent the inner radius and length of the cylindrical section. The units for each decision variable are inches. The decision variables $x_1$ and $x_2$ are integer multiples of 0.0625 inches, which is the available thickness of rolled steel plates. That makes the decision variables a mix of continuous and discrete variables. The Pareto front for the problem is disconnected.

The objective functions and constraints for the reinforced concrete beam design problem are defined as follows:

$$\begin{align}
    &\min_{\mathbf{x}} & f_1(\mathbf{x}) & = 0.6224x_1x_3x_4 + 1.7781x_2x_3^2 + 3.1661x_1^2x_4 + 19.84x_1^2x_3 \\
    & & f_2(\mathbf{x}) & = \sum_{i=1}^3 \max\{g_i(\mathbf{x}), 0\} \\
    &\text{s.t.,}   & g_1(\mathbf{x}) & = -x_1 + 0.0193x_3 \leq 0,\\
    & & g_2(\mathbf{x}) & = -x_2 + 0.00954x_3 \leq 0, \\
    & & g_3(\mathbf{x}) & = -\pi x_3^2x_4 - \frac{4}{3}\pi x_3^3 + 1\ 296\ 000 \leq 0.
\end{align}$$

Here is an approximation of the pressure vessel design problem's Pareto front:

## The hatch cover design problem (RE24)

In the hatch cover design problem [3], the first objective is to minimize the weight of the hatch cover. The second objective is to minimize the sum of the four constraint violations. The two decision variables $x_1$ and $x_2$ represent the flange thickness and the beam height of the hatch cover. Both decision variables are continuous and the Pareto front for the problem is convex.

The objective functions and constraints for the hatch cover design problem are defined as follows:

$$\begin{align}
    &\min_{\mathbf{x}} & f_1(\mathbf{x}) & = x_1 + 120x_2 \\
    & & f_2(\mathbf{x}) & = \sum_{i=1}^4 \max\{g_i(\mathbf{x}), 0\} \\
    &\text{s.t.,}   & g_1(\mathbf{x}) & = 1.0 - \frac{\sigma_b}{\sigma_{b,max}} \geq 0,\\
    & & g_2(\mathbf{x}) & = 1.0 - \frac{\tau}{\tau_{max}} \geq 0, \\
    & & g_3(\mathbf{x}) & = 1.0 - \frac{\delta}{\delta_{max}} \geq 0, \\
    & & g_4(\mathbf{x}) & = 1.0 - \frac{\sigma_b}{\sigma_{k}} \geq 0,
\end{align}$$

where $x_1 \in [0.5, 4]$ and $x_2 \in [4, 50]$. The parameters are defined as $\sigma_{b,max} = 700 kg/cm^2$, $\tau_{max} = 450 kg/cm$, $\delta_{max} = 1.5 cm$, $\sigma_k = Ex_1^2/100 kg/cm^2$, $\sigma_b = 4500/(x_1x_2) kg/cm^2$, $\tau = 1800/x_2 kg/cm^2$, $\delta = 56.2 \times 10^4/(Ex_1x_2^2)$, and $E = 700\ 000 kg/cm^2$.

Here is an approximation of the hatch cover design problem's Pareto front:

## UTOPIA forest problem

The UTOPIA forest problem aims to find climate-smart solutions. It is a three-objective problem
with the objectives representing the net present value, wood volume at the end of the planning
period and the profit from harvesting. As seen in the following formulation, all these objectives
are to be maximized.

The UTOPIA forest problem is defined as follows:

$$\begin{align}
    \max_{\mathbf{x}} & \quad \sum_{j=1}^N\sum_{i \in I_j} v_{ij} x_{ij} & \\
    & \quad \sum_{j=1}^N\sum_{i \in I_j} w_{ij} x_{ij} & \\
    & \quad \sum_{j=1}^N\sum_{i \in I_j} p_{ij} x_{ij} & \\
    \text{s.t.} & \quad \sum\limits_{i \in I_j} x_{ij} = 1, & \forall j = 1 \ldots N \\
    & \quad x_{ij}\in \{0,1\}& \forall j = 1 \ldots N, ~\forall i\in I_j,
\end{align}$$

where $x_{ij}$ are decision variables representing the choice of implementing management plan $i$ in stand $j$,
and $I_j$ is the set of available management plans for stand $j$. For each plan $i$ in stand $j$
the net present value, wood volume at the end of the planning period, and the profit from harvesting
are represented by $v_{ij}$, $w_{ij}$, and $p_{ij}$ respectively.

### Implementation

The implemented problem takes one compulsory argument `data` and two optional arguments, `holding` and `comparing`.
The `data` argument is a list of strings that has the locations of (or paths to) the two data files used in the problem definition.
In index 1 (as second element in the list) should be the "key" file.
The second argument `holding` is an integer value representing the number of the holding in question and defaults to 1.
The third argument `comparing` is a boolean value meant for testing purposes to compare the results gained with this implemetation
to the ones from a previous implementation.
This argument is therefore only relevant in testing the formulation and defaults to False.

In the problem implementation, the decision variables are defined as vectors $\mathbf{X}_i$, where $i$ is the number of
unique units in the holding in question, and the number of elements in each decision variable represents the
number of unique management schedules in the holding.
Each element in the decision variables is a binary, that can only have the values 0 or 1.
As only one plan is ultimately chosen for each unit, only one element can have value 1 in each decision variable.
A decision variable could look like this:

`X_4 = [0, 0, 0, 1, 0]`,

where the fourth management plan would be executed for the unit with index 4.

### Usage

To use the UTOPIA forest problem, first you need to import and initialize the problem.

```python
from desdeo.problem import forest_problem

problem = forest_problem(data=["./tests/data/alternatives_290124.csv", "./tests/data/alternatives_key_290124.csv"], holding=2)
```

Above, we first import the problem and then initialize it for holding number 2.
The data files in DESDEO are located in the `tests/data` directory.

When using the UTOPIA forest problem, to see if it is used correctly, you can try optimizing one objective at a time
and see whether the objective values match the ideal values of the objectives.
The ideal values for each objective can be found in the problem definition and can be accessed in code as follows:

```python
ideal = problem.get_ideal_point()
```

The above returns the ideal values as a python dict. For holding 2 the ideal would be

```python
{'f_1': 42937.004, 'f_2': 2489.819, 'f_3': 53632.887}
```

You can then test optimizing each objective separately by using one of the solvers in DESDEO (that supports tensors)
and seeing if the results match each corresponding ideal value.
If testing a new solver, replace `GurobipySolver` in the following example with the new solver.

```python
import numpy as np
from desdeo.problem import objective_dict_to_numpy_array
from desdeo.tools import GurobipySolver # you can replace this with any solver that supports tensors

# initialize the solver
solver = GurobipySolver(problem) # again, replace GurobipySolver with the solver being tested

# optimize each objective separately
f_1_results = solver.solve("f_1_min").optimal_objectives # always solve using <objective_symbol>_min
f_2_results = solver.solve("f_2_min").optimal_objectives
f_3_results = solver.solve("f_3_min").optimal_objectives

# gather the results into an array
results = [f_1_results["f_1"], f_2_results["f_2"], f_3_results["f_3"]]

# turn the ideal dict into a numpy array for comparing purposes
ideal_array = objective_dict_to_numpy_array(problem, ideal)

# check that the results are close to the ideal values
np.allclose(results, ideal_array)
```

If everything works, `np.allclose(results, ideal_array)` returns `True`.
