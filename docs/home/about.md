## What is DESDEO?

DESDEO is an open source software framework for interactive multiobjective optimization.
Interactive methods are tools to support decision-making in problems with
multiple conflicting objective functions, or in other words,
multiobjective optimization problems. These problems have multiple
optimal solutions, known as Pareto optimal solutions, which are represented
by numerical vectors, and are therefore incomparable on a mathematical basis alone.
To find the best solution among the Pareto optimal ones, preferences from a decision
maker can be utilized. The goal of interactive multiobjective optimization methods
is to aid a decision maker in finding their most preferred solution among the Pareto
optimal ones by leveraging the preferences expressed by the decision maker.

**If none of the above made sense to you**, then do not worry! This documentation
provides a primer on multiobjective optimization to get anyone with a basic understanding
on mathematics and optimization quickly up to date about interactive multiobjective optimization
and interactive methods are. The primer can be accessed [here](../tutorials/moo_primer.md).

**If you are a seasoned veteran on multiobjective optimization**, and you
want to start utilizing DESDEO right away, then check the installation guide
[here](../tutorials/installing.md). On the other hand, if you want to contribute
to DESDEO, this documentation provides a tutorial on [that as
well](../tutorials/contributing.md).
