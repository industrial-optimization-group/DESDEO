## What is DESDEO and multiobjective optimization?

DESDEO is an open source software framework for interactive multiobjective optimization.
Interactive methods are tools to support decision-making in problems with
multiple conflicting objective functions, or in other words,
multiobjective optimization problems. These problems have multiple
optimal solutions, known as Pareto optimal solutions, which are represented
by numerical vectors, and are therefore incomparable on a mathematical basis alone.
To find the best solution among the Pareto optimal ones, preferences from a decision
maker can be utilized.

## Interactive methods in multiobjective optimization

Interactive methods are iterative by nature where a decision maker (who has
substance knowledge about the problem being solved) can direct the solution
process with one's preference information to find the most preferred balance
between the objectives. In interactive methods, the amount of information to be
considered at a time is limited and, thus, the cognitive load set on the
decision maker is not too demanding. Furthermore, the decision maker learns
about the interdependencies among the objectives and also the feasibility of
their preferences.

## Mission

The mission of DESDEO is to increase awareness of the benefits of interactive
methods, and make interactive methods readily available and applicable. Thanks to
the open architecture, interactive methods are easier to be utilized and further
developed. The framework consists of reusable components that can be utilized
for implementing new methods or modifying the existing methods. The framework is
released under a permissive open source license.


## The research team behind DESDEO

DESDEO has been an ongoing project driven forward by the Multiobjective
Optimization group at the University of Jyväskylä in Finland.
Many current and past members of the team have contributed to DESDEO.
