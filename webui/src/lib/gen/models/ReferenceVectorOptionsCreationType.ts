/**
 * The method for creating reference vectors. Defaults to "simplex".
Currently only "simplex" is implemented. Future versions will include "s_energy".

If set to "simplex", the reference vectors are created using the simplex lattice design method.
This method is generates distributions with specific numbers of reference vectors.
Check: https://www.itl.nist.gov/div898/handbook/pri/section5/pri542.htm for more information.
If set to "s_energy", the reference vectors are created using the Riesz s-energy criterion. This method is used to
distribute an arbitrary number of reference vectors in the objective space while minimizing the s-energy.
Currently not implemented.
